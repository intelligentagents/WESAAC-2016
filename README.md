# WESAAC 2016 repository

## Local development

Check if you have [all requirements for local environment](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
To install all development dependencies install [Bundler](http://bundler.io/).
```bash
gem install bundler
``` 
and run next command from root folder:

```bash
bundle install
```  

To start Jekyll run:
```bash
jekyll serve -w
```

**NOTE:** in this mode all changes to html and data files will be automatically regenerated, but after changing ```_config.yml``` you have to restart server.
