# WESAAC-2016

#### 10th Workshop-School on Agents, Environments, and Applications

#### Universidade Federal de Alagoas <br> 23-25 of May 2016

#### Motivation

Many current computational systems no longer depend on human intervention to operate in complex dynamic environments. Some of the key features that allow such systems to autonomously operate include the ability to make rational decisions and to react to changes in a timely way. In that respect, agent systems and multi-agent environments provide a computing paradigm that supports the development of intelligent systems that are able to cope with the complexities associated with such dynamic scenarios.

#### Aims

The area of agent-based systems is widely known and has numerous papers published internationally every year. However, nationally there are few events in this area and no other national event also provides tutorials and short courses specifically on the main topics of research within autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. WESAAC is therefore of great importance as a national event in this area, aiming to both prepare future generations of Brazilian researchers and to disseminate the current projects of Brazilian researchers. WESAAC aims to be a forum for the discussion of work at all levels, including undergraduate, MSc, and PhD projects currently being conducted. Fundamentally, WESAAC is the best opportunity for Brazilian undergraduate and specially postgraduate students to attend courses by some of the most prominent researchers working in this area throughout the world.

**Paper Submission Deadline**: February 22, 2016 <br>
**Paper Acceptance Notification**: April 15, 2016 <br>
**Final Version Deadline**: April 29, 2016

#### Paper Submission

Researchers and students are invited to submit papers in Portuguese or English, as a PDF file formatted according to the SBC style (compulsory) available at <http://www.sbc.org.br/index.php?option=com_jdownloads&Itemid=195&task=view.download&catid=32&cid=38>.

The proceedings are published electronically (with an ISBN). Three separate tracks have been created for paper submission: (i) full papers, (ii) short papers (i.e., extended abstracts), and (iii) short papers written by undergraduate students.

Full papers, reporting work with solid results, must have no more than 12 pages and will be presented orally in a plenary session. Short
papers, reporting ongoing work or position papers, must have between 4 and 6 pages and will be presented in poster sessions.

Papers must be submitted through EasyChair <https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wesaac2016>. For queries related to paper submission, please send an email to <wesaac2016@gmail.com>.
